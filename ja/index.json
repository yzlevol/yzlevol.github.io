The original aim of Blowfish was to develop a theme that was simple and lightweight. The theme is a fork of Congo and expands its initial vision.\nTailwind CSS 3.0 # Tailwind CSS is at the heart of Blowfish and this release contains the very latest Tailwind CSS version 3. It brings with it performance optimisations and support for some great new CSS features.\nMultilingual support # A highly requested feature, Blowfish is now multilingual! If you publish your content in multiple languages, the site will be built with all the translations available.\n:gb: :de: :fr: :es: :cn: :brazil: :tr: :bangladesh: Thanks to submissions from the community, Blowfish has already been translated into twenty-six languages with more to be added over time. By the way, pull requests for new languages are always welcome!\nRTL language support # One of the benefits of the new Tailwind and Multilingual features is the ability to add RTL language support. When enabled, the entire site will reflow content from right-to-left. Every element in the theme has been restyled to ensure it looks great in this mode which aids authors who wish to generate content in RTL languages.\nRTL is controlled on a per-language basis so you can mix and match both RTL and LTR content in your projects and the theme will respond accordingly.\nAutomatic image resizing # A big change in Blowfish 2.0 is the addition of automatic image resizing. Using the power of Hugo Pipes, images in Markdown content are now automatically scaled to different output sizes. These are then presented using HTML srcset attributes enabling optimised file sizes to be served to your site visitors.\n\u0026lt;!-- Markdown: ![My image](image.jpg) --\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img srcset=\u0026#34; /image_320x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 320w, /image_635x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 635w, /image_1024x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 1024w, /image_1270x0_resize_q75_box.jpg 2x\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;/image_635x0_resize_q75_box.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;My image\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Best of all there\u0026rsquo;s nothing you need to change! Simply insert standard Markdown image syntax and let the theme do the rest. If you want a little more control, the figure shortcode has been completely rewritten to provide the same resizing benefits.\nSite search # Powered by Fuse.js, site search allows visitors to quickly and easily find your content. All searches are performed client-side meaning there\u0026rsquo;s nothing to configure on the server and queries are performed super fast. Simply enable the feature in your site configuration and you\u0026rsquo;re all set. Oh, and it also supports full keyboard navigation!\nTables of contents # A highly requested feature, Blowfish now supports tables of contents on article pages. You can see it in action on this page. The contents are fully responsive and will adjust to take advantage of the space available at different screen resolutions.\nAvailable on a global or per article basis, the table of contents can be fully customised using standard Hugo configuration values, allowing you to adjust the behaviour to suit your project.\nAccessibility improvements # From adding ARIA descriptions to more items or simply adjusting the contrast of certain text elements, this release is the most accessible yet.\nVersion 2 also introduces \u0026ldquo;skip to content\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;scroll to top\u0026rdquo; links that enable quick navigation. There\u0026rsquo;s also keyboard shortcuts for enabling items like search without reaching for the mouse.\nThe new image resizing features also provide full control over alt and title elements enabling an accessible experience for all visitors.\nA whole lot more # There\u0026rsquo;s countless other features to explore. From being able to display taxonomies on articles and list pages, to using the new headline author parameter to customise your homepage. There\u0026rsquo;s also improved JSON-LD structured data which further optimises SEO performance.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/docs/welcome/","section":"資料","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"lead text-neutral-500 dark:text-neutral-400 !mb-9 text-xl\"\u003e\n  Blowfish is packed with tons of features.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe original aim of Blowfish was to develop a theme that was simple and lightweight.

You can check if it\u0026rsquo;s already installed by running the command hugo version.\nMake sure you are using Hugo version 0.87.0 or later as the theme takes advantage of some of the latest Hugo features. You can find detailed installation instructions for your platform in the Hugo docs.\nBlowfish Tools (recommended) # We just launched a new CLI tool to help you get started with Blowfish. It will create a new Hugo project, install the theme and set up the theme configuration files for you. It\u0026rsquo;s still in beta so please report any issues you find.\nInstall the CLI tool globally using npm (or other package manager):\nnpx blowfish-tools or\nnpm i -g blowfish-tools Then run the command blowfish-tools to start an interactive run which will guide you through creation and configuration use-cases.\nblowfish-tools You can also run the command blowfish-tools new to create a new Hugo project and install the theme in one go. Check the CLI help for more information.\nblowfish-tools new mynewsite Here\u0026rsquo;s a quick video of how fast it is to get started with Blowfish using the CLI tool:\nInstall without CLI # Create a new site # Run the command hugo new site mywebsite to create a new Hugo site in a directory named mywebsite.\nNote that you can name the project directory whatever you choose, but the instructions below will assume it\u0026rsquo;s named mywebsite. If you use a different name, be sure to substitute it accordingly.\nDownload the Blowfish theme # There several different ways to install the Blowfish theme into your Hugo website. From easiest to most difficult to install and maintain, they are:\nGit submodule (recommended) Hugo module Manual file copy If you\u0026rsquo;re unsure, choose the Git submodule method.\nInstall using git # This method is the quickest and easiest for keeping the theme up-to-date. Besides Hugo and Go, you\u0026rsquo;ll also need to ensure you have Git installed on your local machine.\nChange into the directory for your Hugo website (that you created above), initialise a new git repository and add Blowfish as a submodule.\ncd mywebsite git init git submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Then continue to set up the theme configuration files.\nInstall using Hugo # For this method you\u0026rsquo;ll use Hugo to manage your themes. Hugo uses Go to initialise and manage modules so you need to ensure you have go installed before proceeding.\nDownload and install Go. You can check if it\u0026rsquo;s already installed by using the command go version.\nMake sure you are using Go version 1.12 or later as Hugo requires this for modules to work correctly. From your Hugo project directory (that you created above), initialise modules for your website:\n# If you\u0026#39;re managing your project on GitHub hugo mod init github.com/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;repo-name\u0026gt; # If you\u0026#39;re managing your project locally hugo mod init my-project Add the theme to your configuration by creating a new file config/_default/module.toml and adding the following:\n[[imports]] disable = false path = \u0026#34;github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/v2\u0026#34; Start your server using hugo server and the theme will be downloaded automatically.\nContinue to set up the theme configuration files.\nInstall manually # Download the latest release of the theme source code.\nDownload from Github Extract the archive, rename the folder to blowfish and move it to the themes/ directory inside your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s root folder.\nContinue to set up the theme configuration files.\nSet up theme configuration files # In the root folder of your website, delete the hugo.toml file that was generated by Hugo. Copy the *.toml config files from the theme into your config/_default/ folder. This will ensure you have all the correct theme settings and will enable you to easily customise the theme to your needs.\nNote: You should not overwrite the module.toml file if one already exists in your project! Depending on how you installed the theme you will find the theme config files in different places:\nHugo Modules: In the Hugo cache directory, or download a copy from GitHub Git submodule or Manual install: themes/blowfish/config/_default Once you\u0026rsquo;ve copied the files, your config folder should look like this:\nconfig/_default/ ├─ hugo.toml ├─ languages.en.toml ├─ markup.toml ├─ menus.en.toml ├─ module.toml # if you installed using Hugo Modules └─ params.toml Important: If you didn\u0026rsquo;t use Hugo Modules to install Blowfish, you must add the line theme = \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; to the top of your hugo.toml file. Next steps # The basic Blowfish installation is now complete. Continue to the Getting Started section to learn more about configuring the theme.\nInstalling updates # From time to time there will be new releases posted that apply fixes and add new functionality to the theme. In order to take advantage of these changes, you will need to update the theme files on your website.\nHow you go about this will depend on the installation method you chose when the theme was originally installed. Instructions for each method can be found below.\nGit submodule Hugo module Manual file copy Update using git # Git submodules can be updated using the git command. Simply execute the following command and the latest version of the theme will be downloaded into your local repository:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge Once the submodule has been updated, rebuild your site and check everything works as expected.\nUpdate using Hugo # Hugo makes updating modules super easy. Simply change into your project directory and execute the following command:\nhugo mod get -u Hugo will automatically update any modules that are required for your project. It does this by inspecting your module.toml and go.mod files. If you have any issues with the update, check to ensure these files are still configured correctly.\nThen simply rebuild your site and check everything works as expected.\nUpdate manually # Updating Blowfish manually requires you to download the latest copy of the theme and replace the old version in your project.\nNote that any local customisations you have made to the theme files will be lost during this process. Download the latest release of the theme source code.\nDownload from Github Extract the archive, rename the folder to blowfish and move it to the themes/ directory inside your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s root folder.

We just launched a CLI tool to help you get started with Blowfish. It will help you with installation and configuration. Install the CLI tool globally using:\nnpx blowfish-tools The config files that ship with Blowfish contain all of the possible settings that the theme recognises. By default, many of these are commented out but you can simply uncomment them to activate or change a specific feature.\nBasic configuration # Before creating any content, there are a few things you should set for a new installation. Starting in the hugo.toml file, set the baseURL and languageCode parameters. The languageCode should be set to the main language that you will be using to author your content.\n# config/_default/hugo.toml baseURL = \u0026#34;https://your_domain.com/\u0026#34; languageCode = \u0026#34;en\u0026#34; The next step is to configure the language settings. Although Blowfish supports multilingual setups, for now, just configure the main language.\nLocate the languages.en.toml file in the config folder. If your main language is English you can use this file as is. Otherwise, rename it so that it includes the correct language code in the filename. For example, for French, rename the file to languages.fr.toml.\nNote that the language code in the language config filename should match the languageCode setting in hugo.toml. # config/_default/languages.en.toml title = \u0026#34;My awesome website\u0026#34; [author] name = \u0026#34;My name\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;img/author.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;A generally awesome human\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;A little bit about me\u0026#34; links = [ { twitter = \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/username\u0026#34; } ] The [author] configuration determines how the author information is displayed on the website. The image should be placed in the site\u0026rsquo;s assets/ folder. Links will be displayed in the order they are listed.\nIf you need extra detail, further information about each of these configuration options, is covered in the Configuration section.\nColour schemes # Blowfish ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the scheme, simply set the colorScheme theme parameter. Valid options are blowfish (default), avocado, fire, ocean, forest, princess, neon, bloody, terminal, marvel, noir, autumn, congo, andslate.\n# config/_default/params.toml colorScheme = \u0026#34;blowfish\u0026#34; Blowfish defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. Each main colour contains ten shades which are based upon the colours that are included in Tailwind. The three main colours are used for the header, footer, and accent colours. Here are the colors for each scheme:\nBlowfish (default) # Avocado # Fire # Ocean # Forest # Princess # Neon # Bloody # Terminal # Marvel # Noir # Autumn # Congo # Slate # Although these are the default schemes, you can also create your own. Refer to the Advanced Customisation section for details.\nOrganising content # By default, Blowfish doesn\u0026rsquo;t force you to use a particular content type. In doing so you are free to define your content as you wish. You might prefer pages for a static site, posts for a blog, or projects for a portfolio.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a quick overview of a basic Blowfish project. All content is placed within the content folder:\n. ├── assets │ └── img │ └── author.jpg ├── config │ └── _default ├── content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── about.md │ └── posts │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-post.md │ └── another-post │ ├── aardvark.jpg │ └── index.md └── themes └── blowfish It\u0026rsquo;s important to have a firm grasp of how Hugo expects content to be organised as the theme is designed to take full advantage of Hugo page bundles. Be sure to read the official Hugo docs for more information.\nBlowfish is also flexible when it comes to taxonomies. Some people prefer to use tags and categories to group their content, others prefer to use topics.\nHugo defaults to using posts, tags and categories out of the box and this will work fine if that\u0026rsquo;s what you want. If you wish to customise this, however, you can do so by creating a taxonomies.toml configuration file:\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml topic = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; This will replace the default tags and categories with topics. Refer to the Hugo Taxonomy docs for more information on naming taxonomies.\nWhen you create a new taxonomy, you will need to adjust the navigation links on the website to point to the correct sections, which is covered below.\nMenus # Blowfish has two menus that can be customised to suit the content and layout of your site. The main menu appears in the site header and the footer menu appears at the bottom of the page just above the copyright notice.\nBoth menus are configured in the menus.en.toml file. Similarly to the languages config file, if you wish to use another language, rename this file and replace en with the language code you wish to use.\n# config/_default/menus.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Blog\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Topics\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;topics\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;GitHub\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; weight = 30 [[main]] identifier = \u0026#34;github2\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; weight = 40 [[footer]] name = \u0026#34;Privacy\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;https://external-link\u0026#34; The name parameter specifies the text that is used in the menu link. You can also optionally provide a title which fills the HTML title attribute for the link.\nThe pageRef parameter allows you to easily reference Hugo content pages and taxonomies. It is the quickest way to configure the menu as you can simply refer to any Hugo content item and it will automatically build the correct link. To link to external URLs, the url parameter can be used.\nThe pre parameter allows you to place an icon from Blowfish\u0026rsquo;s icon set on the menu entry. This parameter can be used with name parameter or by itself. If you want to use multiple menu entries with just icons please set the identifierparameter otherwise Hugo will default to the naming tag as the id and probably not display all the menu entries.\nMenu links will be sorted from lowest to highest weight, and then alphabetically by name.\nBoth menus are completely optional and can be commented out if not required. Use the template provided in the file as a guide.\nNested menus # The theme also supports nested menus. In order to use them you just need to define a parent entry in menu.toml and its sub-menus using the parent parameter to reference the parent. All properties can be used for sub-menus. pageRef and url can also be used in the parent entry. Nested menus are only available in the main menu not for the footer.\n# config/_default/menus.toml [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Parent\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;sub-menu 1\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;Parent\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;samples\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;sub-menu 2\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;Parent\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;samples\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;sub-menu 3\u0026#34; parent = \u0026#34;Parent\u0026#34; pre = \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;samples\u0026#34; weight = 20 Sub-Navigation menu # Additionally, you can also configure a sub-navigation menu. Just define new menu entries as subnavigation in menus.toml. This will render a second line with sub-categories below the main header menu.\n# config/_default/menus.toml [[subnavigation]] name = \u0026#34;An interesting topic\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags/interesting-topic\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[subnavigation]] name = \u0026#34;My Awesome Category\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;categories/awesome\u0026#34; weight = 20 The default name is the pageRef title cased.\nThumbnails \u0026amp; Backgrounds # Blowfish was built so it would be easy to add visual support to your articles. If your familiar with Hugo article structure, you just need to place an image file (almost all formats are supported but we recommend .png or .jpg) that starts with feature* inside your article folder. And that\u0026rsquo;s it, Blowfish will then be able to both use the image as a thumbnail within your website as well as for oEmbed cards across social platforms.\nHere is also a guide with more info and a sample if you want to see how you can do it.\nAdditionally, Blowfish also supports background hero images in articles and lists. In order to use a different image than the featured one, add an image file in which the name starts with background*.\nDetailed configuration # The steps above are the bare minimum configuration. If you now run hugo server you will be presented with a blank Blowfish website. Detailed configuration is covered in the Configuration section.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/docs/getting-started/","section":"資料","summary":"\u003cdiv\n  \n    class=\"flex px-4 py-3 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900\"\n  \u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"text-primary-400 ltr:pr-3 rtl:pl-3 flex items-center\"\n    \u003e\n\n    \n\n  \u003cspan class=\"relative block icon\"\u003e\n    \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"\u003e\u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M506.3 417l-213.3-364c-16.33-28-57.54-28-73.98 0l-213.2 364C-10.59 444.9 9.849 480 42.74 480h426.6C502.1 480 522.6 445 506.3 417zM232 168c0-13.25 10.75-24 24-24S280 154.8 280 168v128c0 13.25-10.75 24-23.1 24S232 309.3 232 296V168zM256 416c-17.36 0-31.44-14.08-31.44-31.44c0-17.36 14.07-31.44 31.44-31.44s31.44 14.08 31.44 31.44C287.4 401.9 273.4 416 256 416z\"/\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"dark:text-neutral-300\"\n    \u003eThis section assumes you have already \u003ca href=\"https://yzlevol.github.io/ja/docs/installation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstalled the Blowfish theme\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003c/br\u003e\n\n  \n\n\n\n\u003cdiv\n  \n    class=\"flex px-4 py-3 rounded-md bg-primary-100 dark:bg-primary-900\"\n  \u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"text-primary-400 ltr:pr-3 rtl:pl-3 flex items-center\"\n    \u003e\n\n    \n\n  \u003cspan class=\"relative block icon\"\u003e\n    \u003csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 448 512\"\u003e\n\u003cpath fill=\"currentColor\"  d=\"M159.3 5.4c7.8-7.3 19.9-7.2 27.7 .1c27.6 25.9 53.5 53.8 77.7 84c11-14.4 23.5-30.1 37-42.9c7.9-7.4 20.1-7.4 28 .1c34.6 33 63.9 76.6 84.5 118c20.3 40.8 33.8 82.5 33.8 111.9C448 404.2 348.2 512 224 512C98.4 512 0 404.1 0 276.5c0-38.4 17.8-85.3 45.4-131.7C73.3 97.7 112.7 48.6 159.3 5.4zM225.7 416c25.3 0 47.7-7 68.8-21c42.1-29.4 53.4-88.2 28.1-134.4c-2.8-5.6-5.6-11.2-9.8-16.8l-50.6 58.8s-81.4-103.6-87.1-110.6C133.1 243.8 112 273.2 112 306.8C112 375.4 162.6 416 225.7 416z\"/\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n\n  \u003c/span\u003e\n\n  \u003cspan\n    \n      class=\"dark:text-neutral-300\"\n    \u003e\u003cp\u003eWe just launched a CLI tool to help you get started with Blowfish.

The table below outlines all the settings that the Blowfish takes advantage of.\nNote that the variable names provided in this table use dot notation to simplify the TOML data structure (ie. outputs.home refers to [outputs] home).\nName Default Description theme \u0026quot;blowfish\u0026quot; When using Hugo Modules this config value should be removed. For all other installation types, this must be set to blowfish for the theme to function. baseURL Not set The URL to the root of the website. defaultContentLanguage \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; This value determines the default language of theme components and content. Refer to the language and i18n section below for supported language codes. enableRobotsTXT true When enabled, a robots.txt file will be created in the site root that allows search engines to crawl the entire site. If you prefer to provide your own pre-made robots.txt, set to false and place your file in the static directory. For complete control, you may provide a custom layout to generate this file. paginate 10 The number of articles listed on each page of the article listing. summaryLength 0 The number of words that are used to generate the article summary when one is not provided in the front matter. A value of 0 will use the first sentence. This value has no effect when summaries are hidden. outputs.home [\u0026quot;HTML\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;RSS\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;JSON\u0026quot;] The output formats that are generated for the site. Blowfish requires HTML, RSS and JSON for all theme components to work correctly. permalinks Not set Refer to the Hugo docs for permalink configuration. taxonomies Not set Refer to the Organising content section for taxonomy configuration. Thumbnails # Blowfish was built so it would be easy to add visual support to your articles. If your familiar with Hugo article structure, you just need to place an image file (almost all formats are supported but we recommend .png or .jpg) that starts with feature* inside your article folder. And that\u0026rsquo;s it, Blowfish will then able to both use the image as a thumbnail within your website as well as for oEmbed cards across social platforms.\nHere is also a guide with more info and a sample if you want to see how you can do it.\nLanguage and i18n # Blowfish is optimised for full multilingual websites and theme assets are translated into several languages out of the box. The language configuration allows you to generate multiple versions of your content to provide a customised experience to your visitors in their native language.\nThe theme currently supports the following languages by default:\nLanguage Code Arabic ar Bulgarian bg Bengali bn Catalan ca Czech cs German de English en Spanish (Spain) es Finnish fi French fr Hebrew he Croatian hr Hungarian hu Indonesian id Italian it Japanese ja Korean ko Polish pl Portuguese (Brazil) pt-br Portuguese (Portugal) pt-pt Romanian ro Russian ru Turkish tr Vietnamese vi Simplified Chinese (China) zh-cn Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) zh-tw The default translations can be overridden by creating a custom file in i18n/[code].yaml that contains the translation strings. You can also use this method to add new languages. If you\u0026rsquo;d like to share a new translation with the community, please open a pull request.\nConfiguration # In order to be as flexible as possible, a language configuration file needs to be created for each language on the website. By default Blowfish includes an English language configuration at config/_default/languages.en.toml.\nThe default file can be used as a template to create additional languages, or renamed if you wish to author your website in a language other than English. Simply name the file using the format languages.[language-code].toml.\nNote: Ensure the defaultContentLanguage parameter in the site configuration matches the language code in your language config filename. Global # Name Default Description languageCode \u0026quot;en\u0026quot; The Hugo language code for this file. It can be a top-level language (ie. en) or a sub-variant (ie. en-au) and should match the language code in the filename. Hugo expects this value to always be in lowercase. For proper HTML compliance, set the isoCode parameter which is case-sensitive. languageName \u0026quot;English\u0026quot; The name of the language. weight 1 The weight determines the order of languages when building multilingual sites. title \u0026quot;Blowfish\u0026quot; The title of the website.

Custom links can be added by providing corresponding SVG icon assets in assets/icons/. Menus # Blowfish also supports language-specific menu configurations. Menu config files follow the same naming format as the languages file. Simply provide the language code in the file name to tell Hugo which language the file relates to.\nMenu config files are named with the format menus.[language-code].toml. Always ensure that the language code used in the menus configuration matches the languages configuration.\nThe Getting Started section explains more about the structure of this file. You can also refer to the Hugo menu docs for more configuration examples.\nTheme parameters # Blowfish provides a large number of configuration parameters that control how the theme functions.

The shortcode replaces the base Hugo functionality in order to provide additional performance benefits.\nWhen a provided image is a page resource, it will be optimised using Hugo Pipes and scaled in order to provide images appropriate to different device resolutions. If a static asset or URL to an external image is provided, it will be included as-is without any image processing by Hugo.\nThe figure shortcode accepts six parameters:\nParameter Description src Required. The local path/filename or URL of the image. When providing a path and filename, the theme will attempt to locate the image using the following lookup order: Firstly, as a page resource bundled with the page; then an asset in the assets/ directory; then finally, a static image in the static/ directory. alt Alternative text description for the image. caption Markdown for the image caption, which will be displayed below the image. class Additional CSS classes to apply to the image. href URL that the image should be linked to. target The target attribute for the href URL. nozoom nozoom=true disables the image \u0026ldquo;zoom\u0026rdquo; functionality. This is most useful in combination with a href link. default Special parameter to revert to default Hugo figure behaviour. Simply provide default=true and then use normal Hugo shortcode syntax. Blowfish also supports automatic conversion of images included using standard Markdown syntax. Simply use the following format and the theme will handle the rest:\n![Alt text](image.jpg \u0026#34;Image caption\u0026#34;) Example:\n{{\u0026lt; figure src=\u0026#34;abstract.jpg\u0026#34; alt=\u0026#34;Abstract purple artwork\u0026#34; caption=\u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;!-- OR --\u0026gt; ![Abstract purple artwork](abstract.jpg \u0026#34;Photo by [Jr Korpa](https://unsplash.com/@jrkorpa) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)\u0026#34;) Photo by Jr Korpa on Unsplash Gallery # gallery allows you to showcase multiple images at once, in a responsive manner with more varied and interesting layouts.\nIn order to add images to the gallery, use img tags for each image and add class=\u0026quot;grid-wXX\u0026quot; in order for the gallery to be able to identify the column width for each image. The widths available by default start at 10% and go all the way to 100% in 5% increments. For example, to set the width to 65%, set the class to grid-w65. Additionally, widths for 33% and 66% are also available in order to build galleries with 3 cols. You can also leverage tailwind\u0026rsquo;s responsive indicators to have a reponsive grid.\nExample 1: normal gallery\n{{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/01.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/02.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/03.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/04.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/05.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/06.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/07.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w33\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /gallery \u0026gt;}} Example 2: responsive gallery\n{{\u0026lt; gallery \u0026gt;}} \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/01.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/02.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/03.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/04.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/05.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/06.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;gallery/07.jpg\u0026#34; class=\u0026#34;grid-w50 md:grid-w33 xl:grid-w25\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; {{\u0026lt; /gallery \u0026gt;}} GitHub Card # github allows you to quickly link a github repository, all while showing and updating in realtime stats about it, such as the number of stars and forks it has.\nParameter Description repo [String] github repo in the format of username/repo Example 1:\n{{\u0026lt; github repo=\u0026#34;nunocoracao/blowfish\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} nunocoracao/blowfish Personal Website \u0026amp; Blog Theme for Hugo HTML 1395 389 GitLab Card # gitlab allows you to quickly link a GitLab Project (GitLab\u0026rsquo;s jargon for repo).

Blowfish includes a number of built-in icons for social, links and other purposes. Check the icon samples page for a full list of supported icons.\nCustom icons can be added by providing your own icon assets in the assets/icons/ directory of your project. The icon can then be referenced in the shortcode by using the SVG filename without the .svg extension.\nIcons can also be used in partials by calling the icon partial.\nKaTeX # The katex shortcode can be used to add mathematical expressions to article content using the KaTeX package. Refer to the online reference of supported TeX functions for the available syntax.\nTo include mathematical expressions in an article, simply place the shortcode anywhere with the content. It only needs to be included once per article and KaTeX will automatically render any markup on that page. Both inline and block notation are supported.\nInline notation can be generated by wrapping the expression in \\\\( and \\\\) delimiters. Alternatively, block notation can be generated using $$ delimiters.\nExample:\n{{\u0026lt; katex \u0026gt;}} \\\\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\\\) \\(f(a,b,c) = (a^2+b^2+c^2)^3\\)\nCheck out the mathematical notation samples page for more examples.\nKeyword # The keyword component can be used to visually highlight certain important words or phrases, e.g. professional skills etc. The keywordList shortcode can be used to group together multiple keyword items.

For those use-cases, Blowfish allows users to extend the list of authors using the multiple authors feature.\nTo keep everything backwards compatible, this feature only allows the definition of extra authors and does not change in any way the previous author functionality which is used via config files.\nCreate Authors # The first step to create new authors is to set up a new folder in ./data/authors. Then you can simply add new json files inside, one for each new author. The name of the file will be the key for that author when referencing it in your articles.\nAs an example, let’s create a file called nunocoracao.json within ./data/authors. The contents of the file should be similar to the ones below. name, image, bio, and social are the 4 parameters supported right for authors. They mimic the configurations available for the default author in the config files.\nNote: the key in the social object will be used to fetch one of the theme’s icons, feel free to use any of the icons available in your setup.\n{ \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Nuno Coração\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;image\u0026#34; : \u0026#34;img/nuno_avatar.jpg\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;bio\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Theme Creator\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;social\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;linkedin\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://linkedin.com/in/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;twitter\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://twitter.com/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;instagram\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://instagram.com/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;medium\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://medium.com/@nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;github\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;goodreads\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;http://goodreads.com/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;keybase\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://keybase.io/nunocoracao\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;reddit\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;https://reddit.com/user/nunoheart\u0026#34; } ] } Reference Authors in Articles # Now that you created one author, the next step is to reference it in one or more articles. In the example below, we reference the author created in the previous step using its key.\nThis will render an extra author using the data provided in the json file. This feature does not change in any way the default author configured for the overall site, and therefore, you can control both separately. Using the showAuthor parameter, you can configure whether to show the default author, that is the normal use-case for a single author blog. The new authors front-matter parameter allows you to define authors specifically to an article, and they will be rendered independently of the configurations for the default site author.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Multiple Authors\u0026#34; date: 2020-08-10 draft: false description: \u0026#34;Configure multiple authors for your articles.\u0026#34; slug: \u0026#34;multi-author\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;authors\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;docs\u0026#34;] showAuthor: true authors: - \u0026#34;nunocoracao\u0026#34; showAuthorsBadges : false --- In the example, which matches the markdown of the current page, both the default author and the new one will be displayed. You can scroll now to see the outcome.\nCreate the Authors Taxonomy # To get lists of articles for each of your authors you can configure the authors taxonomy, which opens up some more configurations that might be interesting. This is an optional step in the process that is not required to display the authors in your articles.\nFirst step is to configure the authors taxonomy in your config.toml file, like in the example below. Even though tag and category are defined by default with Hugo, once you add a specific taxonomies section you need to add them again otherwise the site will not process them.\n[taxonomies] tag = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; category = \u0026#34;categories\u0026#34; author = \u0026#34;authors\u0026#34; And that’s just about it. Now you will have pages that reference your authors and, for each, show the respective list of articles where they participate. You can also use the article.showAuthorsBadges on the config file, or showAuthorsBadges on each article to chose whether to display the authors taxonomy as badges in each post item. As an example, this doc is configured to not display authors but if you look at the sample referenced below you will see the authors displayed as badges.\nLastly, you can add more detail to each author page so that it displays a little bio, links, or whatever information fits your use-case. To achieve that, create a folder with the key to each author inside ./content/authors and inside each folder place a _index.md file. For the example above, we would end up with a .content/authors/nunocoracao/_index.md file. Inside, you can configure the actual name of the author and the contents of their page. Authors in this documentation website are configured like this, so you can have a look by playing around with the site.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Nuno Coração\u0026#34; --- Nuno\u0026#39;s awesome dummy bio.

Simply provide a layouts/partials/comments.html which contains the code required to display your chosen comments.\nYou can use either the built-in Hugo Disqus template, or provide your own custom code. Refer to the Hugo docs for further information.\nOnce the partial has been provided, finer control over where comments are displayed is then managed using the showComments parameter. This value can be set at the theme level in the params.toml config file, or on a per-article basis by including it in the front matter. The parameter defaults to false so it must be set to true in one of these locations in order for comments to be displayed.\nFavicons # Blowfish provides a default set of blank favicons to get started but you can provide your own assets to override them. The easiest way to obtain new favicon assets is to generate them using a third-party provider like favicon.io.\nIcon assets should be placed directly in the static/ folder of your website and named as per the listing below. If you use favicon.io, these will be the filenames that are automatically generated for you, but you can provide your own assets if you wish.\nstatic/ ├─ android-chrome-192x192.png ├─ android-chrome-512x512.png ├─ apple-touch-icon.png ├─ favicon-16x16.png ├─ favicon-32x32.png ├─ favicon.ico └─ site.webmanifest Alternatively, you can also completely override the default favicon behaviour and provide your own favicon HTML tags and assets. Simply provide a layouts/partials/favicons.html file in your project and this will be injected into the site \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; in place of the default assets.\nIcon # Similar to the icon shortcode, you can include icons in your own templates and partials by using Blowfish\u0026rsquo;s icon.html partial. The partial takes one parameter which is the name of the icon to be included.\nExample:\n{{ partial \u0026#34;icon.html\u0026#34; \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; }} Icons are populated using Hugo pipelines which makes them very flexible. Blowfish includes a number of built-in icons for social, links and other purposes. Check the icon samples page for a full list of supported icons.\nCustom icons can be added by providing your own icon assets in the assets/icons/ directory of your project. The icon can then be referenced in the partial by using the SVG filename without the .svg extension.\nIcons can also be used in article content by calling the icon shortcode.\nExtensions # Blowfish also provides for a number of extension partials that allow for expanding upon base functionality.\nArticle link # If you wish to insert additional code after article links, create a layouts/partials/extend-article-link.html file. This is especially powerful when combined with the badge shortcode which can be used to highlight metadata for certain articles.\nHead and Footer # The theme allows for inserting additional code directly into the \u0026lt;head\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;footer\u0026gt; sections of the template.

This page is designed to pull everything together and offer some worked examples that you might like to use in your Hugo project.\nTip: If you\u0026rsquo;re new to Hugo, be sure to check out the official docs to learn more about the concept of page bundles and resources. The examples on this page can all be adapted to different scenarios but hopefully give you some ideas about how to approach formatting a particular content item for your individual project.\nBranch pages # Branch page bundles in Hugo cover items like the homepage, section listings, and taxonomy pages. The important thing to remember about branch bundles is that the filename for this content type is _index.md.\nBlowfish will honour the front matter parameters specified in branch pages and these will override the default settings for that particular page. For example, setting the title parameter in a branch page will allow overriding the page title.\nHomepage # Layout: layouts/index.html Content: content/_index.md The homepage in Blowfish is special in that it\u0026rsquo;s overarching design is controlled by the homepage layout config parameter. You can learn more about this in the Homepage Layout section.\nIf you want to add custom content to this page, you simply need to create a content/_index.md file. Anything in this file will then be included in your homepage.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Welcome to Blowfish!\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This is a demo of adding content to the homepage.\u0026#34; --- Welcome to my website! I\u0026#39;m really happy you stopped by. This example sets a custom title and adds some additional text to the body of the page. Any Markdown formatted text is acceptable, including shortcodes, images and links.\nList pages # Layout: layouts/_default/list.html Content: content/../_index.md List pages group all the pages within into a section and provide a way for visitors to reach each page. A blog or portfolio are examples of a list page as they group together posts or projects.\nCreating a list page is as simple as making a sub-directory in the content folder. For example, to create a \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; section, you would create content/projects/. Then create a Markdown file for each of your projects.\nA list page will be generated by default, however to customise the content, you should also create an _index.md page in this new directory.\n. └── content └── projects ├── _index.md # /projects ├── first-project.md # /projects/first-project └── another-project ├── index.md # /projects/another-project └── project.jpg Hugo will generate URLs for the pages in your projects folder accordingly.\nJust like the homepage, content in the _index.md file will be output into the generated list index. Blowfish will then list any pages in this section below the content.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Projects\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;Learn about some of my projects.\u0026#34; cascade: showReadingTime: false --- This section contains all my current projects. In this example, the special cascade parameter is being used to hide the reading time on any sub-pages within this section. By doing this, any project pages will not have their reading time showing. This is a great way to override default theme parameters for an entire section without having to include them in every individual page.\nThe samples section of this site is an example of a list page.\nTaxonomy pages # List layout: layouts/_default/taxonomy.html Term layout: layouts/_default/term.html Content: content/../_index.md Taxonomy pages come in two forms - taxonomy lists and taxonomy terms. Lists display a listing of each of the terms within a given taxonomy, while terms display a list of pages that are related to a given term.\nThe terminology can get a little confusing so let\u0026rsquo;s explore an example using a taxonomy named animals.\nFirstly, to use taxonomies in Hugo, they have to be configured. This is done by creating a config file at config/_default/taxonomies.toml and defining the taxonomy name.\n# config/_default/taxonomies.toml animal = \u0026#34;animals\u0026#34; Hugo expects taxonomies to be listed using their singular and plural forms, so we add the singular animal equals the plural animals to create our example taxonomy.\nNow that our animals taxonomy exists, it needs to be added to individual content items. It\u0026rsquo;s as simple as inserting it into the front matter:\n--- title: \u0026#34;Into the Lion\u0026#39;s Den\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;This week we\u0026#39;re learning about lions.\u0026#34; animals: [\u0026#34;lion\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cat\u0026#34;] --- This has now created two terms within our animals taxonomy - lion and cat.\nAlthough it\u0026rsquo;s not obvious at this point, Hugo will now be generating list and term pages for this new taxonomy. By default the listing can be accessed at /animals/ and the term pages can be found at /animals/lion/ and /animals/cat/.\nThe list page will list all the terms contained within the taxonomy. In this example, navigating to /animals/ will show a page that has links for \u0026ldquo;lion\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;cat\u0026rdquo; which take visitors to the individual term pages.\nThe term pages will list all the pages contained within that term. These term lists are essentially the same as normal list pages and behave in much the same way.\nIn order to add custom content to taxonomy pages, simply create _index.md files in the content folder using the taxonomy name as the sub-directory name.\n. └── content └── animals ├── _index.md # /animals └── lion └── _index.md # /animals/lion Anything in these content files will now be placed onto the generated taxonomy pages. As with other content, the front matter variables can be used to override defaults. In this way you could have a tag named lion but override the title to be \u0026ldquo;Lion\u0026rdquo;.\nTo see how this looks in reality, check out the tags taxonomy listing on this site.\nLeaf pages # Layout: layouts/_default/single.html Content (standalone): content/../page-name.md Content (bundled): content/../page-name/index.md Leaf pages in Hugo are basically standard content pages. They are defined as pages that don\u0026rsquo;t contain any sub-pages. These could be things like an about page, or an individual blog post that lives in the blog section of the website.\nThe most important thing to remember about leaf pages is that unlike branch pages, leaf pages should be named index.md without an underscore. Leaf pages are also special in that they can be grouped together at the top level of the section and named with a unique name.\n. └── content └── blog ├── first-post.md # /blog/first-post ├── second-post.md # /blog/second-post └── third-post ├── index.md # /blog/third-post └── image.jpg When including assets in a page, like an image, a page bundle should be used. Page bundles are created using a sub-directory with an index.md file. Grouping the assets with the content in its own directory is important as many of the shortcodes and other theme logic assumes that resources are bundled alongside pages.\nExample:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My First Blog Post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 description: \u0026#34;Welcome to my blog!\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;Learn more about me and why I am starting this blog.\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;welcome\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;new\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;about\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;first\u0026#34;] --- _This_ is the content of my blog post. Leaf pages have a wide variety of front matter parameters that can be used to customise how they are displayed.\nExternal links # Blowfish has a special feature that allows links to external pages to appear alongside articles in the article listings. This is useful if you have content on third party websites like Medium, or research papers that you\u0026rsquo;d like to link to, without replicating the content in your Hugo site.\nIn order to create an external link article, some special front matter needs to be set:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My Medium post\u0026#34; date: 2022-01-25 externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://medium.com/\u0026#34; summary: \u0026#34;I wrote a post on Medium.\u0026#34; showReadingTime: false _build: render: \u0026#34;false\u0026#34; list: \u0026#34;local\u0026#34; --- Along with the normal front matter parameters like title and summary, the externalUrl parameter is used to tell Blowfish that this is not an ordinary article. The URL provided here will be where visitors are directed when they select this article.\nAdditionally, we use a special Hugo front matter parameter _build to prevent a normal page for this content being generated - there\u0026rsquo;s no point generating a page since we\u0026rsquo;re linking to an external URL!\nThe theme includes an archetype to make generating these external link articles simple. Just specify -k external when making new content.\nhugo new -k external posts/my-post.md Simple pages # Layout: layouts/_default/simple.html Front Matter: layout: \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot; Blowfish also includes a special layout for simple pages. The simple layout is a full-width template that just places Markdown content into the page without any special theme features.\nThe only features available in the simple layout are breadcrumbs and sharing links. However, the behaviour of these can still be controlled using the normal page front matter variables.\nTo enable the simple layout on a particular page, add the layout front matter variable with a value of \u0026quot;simple\u0026quot;:\n--- title: \u0026#34;My landing page\u0026#34; date: 2022-03-08 layout: \u0026#34;simple\u0026#34; --- This page content is now full-width. Custom layouts # One of the benefits of Hugo is that it makes it easy to create custom layouts for the whole site, individual sections or pages.\nLayouts follow all the normal Hugo templating rules and more information is available in the official Hugo docs.\nOverriding default layouts # Each of the content types discussed above lists the layout file that is used to generate each type of page. If this file is created in your local project it will override the theme template and thus can be used to customise the default style of the website.\nFor example, creating a layouts/_default/single.html file will allow the layout of leaf pages to be completely customised.\nCustom section layouts # It is also simple to create custom layouts for individual content sections. This is useful when you want to make a section that lists a certain type of content using a particular style.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s step through an example that creates a custom \u0026ldquo;Projects\u0026rdquo; page that lists projects using a special layout.\nIn order to do this, structure your content using the normal Hugo content rules and create a section for your projects. Additionally, create a new layout for the projects section by using the same directory name as the content and adding a list.html file.\n. └── content │ └── projects │ ├── _index.md │ ├── first-project.md │ └── second-project.md └── layouts └── projects └── list.html This list.html file will now override the default list template, but only for the projects section. Before we look at this file, lets first look at the individual project files.\n--- title: \u0026#34;Blowfish\u0026#34; date: 2021-08-11 icon: \u0026#34;github\u0026#34; description: \u0026#34;A theme for Hugo built with Tailwind CSS.\u0026#34; topics: [\u0026#34;Hugo\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Web\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Tailwind\u0026#34;] externalUrl: \u0026#34;https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish/\u0026#34; --- In this example we are assigning some metadata for each project that we can then use in our list template.

The metadata in the front matter for each project is used to determine which information is displayed.\nKeep in mind that you\u0026rsquo;ll need to ensure the relevant styles and classes are available, which may require the Tailwind CSS to be recompiled. This is discussed in more detail in the Advanced Customisation section.\nWhen making custom templates like this one, it\u0026rsquo;s always easiest to take a look at how the default Blowfish template works and then use that as a guide.

Read below to learn more about what can be customised and the best way of achieving your desired result.\nIf you need further advice, post your questions on GitHub Discussions.\nHugo project structure # Before leaping into it, first a quick note about Hugo project structure and best practices for managing your content and theme customisations.\nIn summary: Never directly edit the theme files. Only make customisations in your Hugo project\u0026rsquo;s sub-directories, not in the themes directory itself. Blowfish is built to take advantage of all the standard Hugo practices. It is designed to allow all aspects of the theme to be customised and overridden without changing any of the core theme files. This allows for a seamless upgrade experience while giving you total control over the look and feel of your website.\nIn order to achieve this, you should never manually adjust any of the theme files directly. Whether you install using Hugo modules, as a git submodule or manually include the theme in your themes/ directory, you should always leave these files intact.\nThe correct way to adjust any theme behaviour is by overriding files using Hugo\u0026rsquo;s powerful file lookup order. In summary, the lookup order ensures any files you include in your project directory will automatically take precedence over any theme files.\nFor example, if you wanted to override the main article template in Blowfish, you can simply create your own layouts/_default/single.html file and place it in the root of your project. This file will then override the single.html from the theme without ever changing the theme itself. This works for any theme files - HTML templates, partials, shortcodes, config files, data, assets, etc.\nAs long as you follow this simple practice, you will always be able to update the theme (or test different theme versions) without worrying that you will lose any of your custom changes.\nChange image optimization settings # Hugo has various builtin methods to resize, crop and optimize images.\nAs an example - in layouts/partials/article-link/card.html, you have the following code:\n{{ with .Resize \u0026#34;600x\u0026#34; }} \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;w-full thumbnail_card nozoom\u0026#34; style=\u0026#34;background-image:url({{ .RelPermalink }});\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; {{ end }} The default behavior of Hugo here is to resize the image to 600px keeping the ratio.\nIt is worth noting here that default image configurations such as anchor point can also be set in your site configuration as well as in the template itself.\nSee the Hugo docs on image processing for more info.\nColour schemes # Blowfish ships with a number of colour schemes out of the box. To change the basic colour scheme, you can set the colorScheme theme parameter. Refer to the Getting Started section to learn more about the built-in schemes.\nIn addition to the default schemes, you can also create your own and re-style the entire website to your liking. Schemes are created by by placing a \u0026lt;scheme-name\u0026gt;.css file in the assets/css/schemes/ folder. Once the file is created, simply refer to it by name in the theme configuration.\nNote: generating these files manually can be hard, I\u0026rsquo;ve built a nodejs terminal tool to help with that, Fugu. In a nutshell, you pass the main three hex values of your color palette and the program will output a css file that can be imported directly into Blowfish. Blowfish defines a three-colour palette that is used throughout the theme. The three colours are defined as neutral, primary and secondary variants, each containing ten shades of colour.\nDue to the way Tailwind CSS 3.0 calculates colour values with opacity, the colours specified in the scheme need to conform to a particular format by providing the red, green and blue colour values.\n:root { --color-primary-500: 139, 92, 246; } This example defines a CSS variable for the primary-500 colour with a red value of 139, green value of 92 and blue value of 246.\nUse one of the existing theme stylesheets as a template. You are free to define your own colours, but for some inspiration, check out the official Tailwind colour palette reference.\nOverriding the stylesheet # Sometimes you need to add a custom style to style your own HTML elements. Blowfish provides for this scenario by allowing you to override the default styles in your own CSS stylesheet. Simply create a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder.\nThe custom.css file will be minified by Hugo and loaded automatically after all the other theme styles which means anything in your custom file will take precedence over the defaults.\nUsing additional fonts # Blowfish allows you to easily change the font for your site. After creating a custom.css file in your project\u0026rsquo;s assets/css/ folder, place you font file inside a fonts folder within the static root folder.\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── custom.css ... └─── static └── fonts └─── font.ttf This makes the font available to the website. Now, the font can just import it in your custom.css and replaced wherever you see fit. The example below shows what replacing the font for the entire html would look like.\n@font-face { font-family: font; src: url(\u0026#39;/fonts/font.ttf\u0026#39;); } html { font-family: font; } Adjusting the font size # Changing the font size of your website is one example of overriding the default stylesheet. Blowfish makes this simple as it uses scaled font sizes throughout the theme which are derived from the base HTML font size. By default, Tailwind sets the default size to 12pt, but it can be changed to whatever value you prefer.\nCreate a custom.css file using the instructions above and add the following CSS declaration:\n/* Increase the default font size */ html { font-size: 13pt; } Simply by changing this one value, all the font sizes on your website will be adjusted to match this new size. Therefore, to increase the overall font sizes used, make the value greater than 12pt. Similarly, to decrease the font sizes, make the value less than 12pt.\nBuilding the theme CSS from source # If you\u0026rsquo;d like to make a major change, you can take advantage of Tailwind CSS\u0026rsquo;s JIT compiler and rebuild the entire theme CSS from scratch. This is useful if you want to adjust the Tailwind configuration or add extra Tailwind classes to the main stylesheet.\nNote: Building the theme manually is intended for advanced users. Let\u0026rsquo;s step through how building the Tailwind CSS works.\nTailwind configuration # In order to generate a CSS file that only contains the Tailwind classes that are actually being used the JIT compiler needs to scan through all the HTML templates and Markdown content files to check which styles are present in the markup. The compiler does this by looking at the tailwind.config.js file which is included in the root of the theme directory:\n// themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js module.exports = { content: [ \u0026#34;./layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/blowfish/layouts/**/*.html\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;./themes/blowfish/content/**/*.{html,md}\u0026#34;, ], // and more... }; This default configuration has been included with these content paths so that you can easily generate your own CSS file without needing to modify it, provided you follow a particular project structure. Namely, you have to include Blowfish in your project as a subdirectory at themes/blowfish/. This means you cannot easily use Hugo Modules to install the theme and you must go down either the git submodule (recommended) or manual install routes. The Installation docs explain how to install the theme using either of these methods.\nProject structure # In order to take advantage of the default configuration, your project should look something like this\u0026hellip;\n. ├── assets │ └── css │ └── compiled │ └── main.css # this is the file we will generate ├── config # site config │ └── _default ├── content # site content │ ├── _index.md │ ├── projects │ │ └── _index.md │ └── blog │ └── _index.md ├── layouts # custom layouts for your site │ ├── partials │ │ └── extend-article-link/simple.html │ ├── projects │ │ └── list.html │ └── shortcodes │ └── disclaimer.html └── themes └── blowfish # git submodule or manual theme install This example structure adds a new projects content type with its own custom layout along with a custom shortcode and extended partial. Provided the project follows this structure, all that\u0026rsquo;s required is to recompile the main.css file.\nInstall dependencies # In order for this to work you\u0026rsquo;ll need to change into the themes/blowfish/ directory and install the project dependencies. You\u0026rsquo;ll need npm on your local machine for this step.\ncd themes/blowfish npm install Run the Tailwind compiler # With the dependencies installed all that\u0026rsquo;s left is to use Tailwind CLI to invoke the JIT compiler. Navigate back to the root of your Hugo project and issue the following command:\ncd ../.. ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit It\u0026rsquo;s a bit of an ugly command due to the paths involved but essentially you\u0026rsquo;re calling Tailwind CLI and passing it the location of the Tailwind config file (the one we looked at above), where to find the theme\u0026rsquo;s main.css file and then where you want the compiled CSS file to be placed (it\u0026rsquo;s going into the assets/css/compiled/ folder of your Hugo project).\nThe config file will automatically inspect all the content and layouts in your project as well as all those in the theme and build a new CSS file that contains all the CSS required for your website. Due to the way Hugo handles file hierarchy, this file in your project will now automatically override the one that comes with the theme.\nEach time you make a change to your layouts and need new Tailwind CSS styles, you can simply re-run the command and generate the new CSS file. You can also add -w to the end of the command to run the JIT compiler in watch mode.\nMake a build script # To fully complete this solution, you can simplify this whole process by adding aliases for these commands, or do what I do and add a package.json to the root of your project which contains the necessary scripts\u0026hellip;\n// package.json { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;my-website\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0.0\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;description\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;scripts\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;server\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;hugo server -b http://localhost -p 8000\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;dev\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=development ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit -w\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;build\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;NODE_ENV=production ./themes/blowfish/node_modules/tailwindcss/lib/cli.js -c ./themes/blowfish/tailwind.config.js -i ./themes/blowfish/assets/css/main.css -o ./assets/css/compiled/main.css --jit\u0026#34; }, // and more... } Now when you want to work on designing your site, you can invoke npm run dev and the compiler will run in watch mode. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready to deploy, run npm run build and you\u0026rsquo;ll get a clean Tailwind CSS build.\n🙋‍♀️ If you need help, feel free to ask a question on GitHub Discussions.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/docs/advanced-customisation/","section":"資料","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways you can make advanced changes to Blowfish.

You will only need to configure the domain you\u0026rsquo;ll be using.\nThen in the root of your site repository, create a netlify.toml file:\n# netlify.toml [build] command = \u0026#34;hugo mod get -u \u0026amp;\u0026amp; hugo --gc --minify -b $URL\u0026#34; publish = \u0026#34;public\u0026#34; [build.environment] NODE_ENV = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; GO_VERSION = \u0026#34;1.16\u0026#34; TZ = \u0026#34;UTC\u0026#34; # Set to preferred timezone [context.production.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \u0026#34;0.104.1\u0026#34; HUGO_ENV = \u0026#34;production\u0026#34; [context.deploy-preview.environment] HUGO_VERSION = \u0026#34;0.104.1\u0026#34; This configuration assumes you are deploying Blowfish as a Hugo module. If you have installed the theme using another method, change the build command to simply hugo --gc --minify -b $URL.\nWhen you push the config file to your repo, Netlify should automatically deploy your site. You can check the deploy logs in the Netlify UI to check for any errors.\nRender # Deploying to Render is very straightforward and all configuration is via the Render UI.\nCreate a new Static Site and link it to your project\u0026rsquo;s code repository. Then simply configure the build command to be hugo --gc --minify and publish directory to be public.\nThe site will automatically build and deploy whenever you push a change to your repo.\nCloudflare Pages # Cloudflare offers the Pages service that can host Hugo blogs. It builds the site from a git repository and then hosts it on Cloudflare\u0026rsquo;s CDN. Follow their Hugo deployment guide to get started.\nThe Rocket Loader™ feature offered by Cloudflare tries to speed up rendering of web pages with JavaScript, but it breaks the appearance switcher in the theme. It can also cause an annoying light/dark screen flash when browsing your site due to scripts loading in the wrong order.\nThis problem can be fixed by disabling it:\nGo to the Cloudflare dashboard Click on your domain name in the list Click Optimization in the Speed section Scroll down to Rocket Loader™ and disable it Hugo sites built with Blowfish still load very quickly, even with this feature disabled.\nShared hosting, VPS or private web server # Using traditional web hosting, or deploying to your own web server, is as simple as building your Hugo site and transferring the files to your host.\nMake sure that the baseURL parameter in config.toml is set to the full URL to the root of your website (including any sub domains or sub-folders).\nThen build your site using hugo and copy the contents of the output directory to the root of your web server and you will be ready to go. By default, the output directory is named public.\nIf you need a hosting provider, check out Vultr or DigitalOcean. Signing up using these affiliate links will give you up to $100 in free credit so you can try the service.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/ja/docs/hosting-deployment/","section":"資料","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThere are many ways to deploy your Hugo website built with Blowfish.

crafted to build my unique vision for my personal homepage. I also decided to make it an open-source project. Fast-forward to today, and Blowfish has transformed into a thriving open-source project with over 600 stars on GitHub and a user base of hundreds. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to get started and have your website running in a couple of minutes.\nnunocoracao/blowfish Personal Website \u0026amp; Blog Theme for Hugo HTML 1395 389 TL;DR # The goal of this guide is to walk a newcomer to Hugo on how to install, manage, and publish your own website. The final version of the code is available in this repo - for those that would like to jump to the end.\nThe visual style is just one of the many possibilities available in Blowfish. Users are encouraged to check the documentation page and learn how to customize the theme to their needs. Additionally, there are already great examples of the theme from other users available for inspiration. Blowfish also offers several extra features in the form of shortcodes available out of the box in the theme - check them out here and get inspired.\nSetup your environment # Let’s begin by installing all the tools you need. This guide will cover the steps for Mac so these instructions might not apply to your hardware and OS. If you are on Windows or Linux, please consult the guides on how to install Hugo, and GitHub’s CLI for your OS.\nAnyway, if you are using MacOS let’s install brew - a package manager for mac - as that will help installing and managing the other tools.\n/bin/bash -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\u0026#34; Once brew is installed let’s install Git, Hugo and GitHub’s CLI.\nbrew install git brew install hugo brew install gh Create a folder for your code and open a terminal session into it (I chose blowfish-tutorial in the commands below, feel free to call the folder whatever you want).\nmkdir blowfish-tutorial cd blowfish-tutorial Once inside the folder, the next step is to initialize your local git repo.\ngit init -b main Now, let’s create and sync the local repo to a GitHub repo so that your code is stored remotely.\ngh auth login gh repo create git push --set-upstream origin main Check the image below for the options I selected for this guide, again feel free to change names and description to your use-case.\nFinally, create a .gitignore file which allows you to exclude certain files from your repo automatically. I would start with something like the example below.\n#others node_modules .hugo_build.lock # OS generated files .DS_Store .DS_Store? ._* .Spotlight-V100 .Trashes # Hugo public The last step is to save all the changes to the repo.\ngit add . git commit -m “initial commit” git push Create site and configure it # With all the tools ready, creating and configuring your site will be easy. Still within the folder you created in the last section, let’s create an empty Hugo website (with no theme).\nhugo new site --force . Once the scaffolding finishes, try the command below to run your page. Open a browser on https://localhost:1313 to see your site…\nhugo server Ups… Page not found – right? This was expected, even though you created a website, Hugo doesn’t give any default experience – aka your site doesn’t have any page to show.\nNext step, let\u0026rsquo;s install Blowfish using git submodules which will make it easier to manage and upgrade to new versions in the future.\ngit submodule add -b main https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish.git themes/blowfish Next, create the following folder structure at the root of your code directory - config/_default/. Now you will need to download these files and place them in _default folder you just created. The final structure should look something like this.\nconfig/_default/ ├─ config.toml ├─ languages.en.toml ├─ markup.toml ├─ menus.en.toml └─ params.toml ` Open the config.toml and uncomment the line theme = \u0026ldquo;blowfish” and you are ready to go. Try the running the site again and check the result at https://localhost:1313\nhugo server You should see something like the image below. Not much yet as we didn’t add any content, but the main skeleton for Blowfish is already in place - just requires configuration.\nNow let’s configure the theme.\nFYI This guide will not cover in detail what each parameter available in Blowfish does – for everything available and how to use it, check Blowfish documentation for every option in every file. menus.en.toml # This file defines your menu structure, for the top banner and the footer. For this guide, let’s create two menu sections: one for Posts and one for Tags.\nPosts - will display the full list of entries Tags - automatically generated based on tags placed on each article To achieve this, make sure the following entries exist in the menus.en.toml file. Once the changes are done, you should see the menus appearing by re-running hugo server.\n[[main]] name = \u0026#34;Posts\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;posts\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[main]] name = \u0026#34;Tags\u0026#34; pageRef = \u0026#34;tags\u0026#34; weight = 30 languages.en.toml # This file will configure your main details as the author of the website. Change the section below to reflect your details.\n[author] name = \u0026#34;Your name here\u0026#34; image = \u0026#34;profile.jpg\u0026#34; headline = \u0026#34;I\u0026#39;m only human\u0026#34; bio = \u0026#34;A little bit about you\u0026#34; # appears in author card for each article The images for the website should be placed in the assets folder. For this step, please add a profile picture to that folder named profile.jpg or change the configuration above to the filename you chose. If you don’t have a profile image available, you can use the one below for the tutorial.\nassets/profile.jpg The last step is configuring your links – social media, GitHub, etc. The file includes all the supported options, but they are commented. You are welcome to uncomment everything and delete the ones you would rather not use. Replace the right links on the ones you decided to keep. You can also change the order.\nparams.toml # This is the main configuration file for Blowfish. Most of the visual options or customization available can be configured using it, and it covers several areas of the theme. For this tutorial, I decided to use a background layout - check other layouts for Blowfish’s landing page - with the Neon color scheme - you can pick a different color scheme if you want to - check this list or create your own.\nAdd an image.jpg to the assets folder which will be the background for the site. You can also download the examples I am using in this tutorial.\nassets/image.jpg Now let’s jump into the params.toml and start configuring the file. I will focus only on the values that need to be changed, don’t delete the rest of the file without reading the docs. Let’s begin by making sure that we have the right color scheme, that image optimization is on, and configure the default background image.\ncolorScheme = \u0026#34;neon\u0026#34; disableImageOptimization = false defaultBackgroundImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used as default for background images Next, let\u0026rsquo;s configure our homepage. We’re going with the background layout, configuring the homepage image and recent items. Furthermore, we are using the card view for items in the recent category. Finally, let’s configure the header to be fixed.\n[homepage] layout = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; # valid options: page, profile, hero, card, background, custom homepageImage = \u0026#34;image.jpg\u0026#34; # used in: hero, and card showRecent = true showRecentItems = 6 showMoreLink = true showMoreLinkDest = \u0026#34;/posts/\u0026#34; cardView = true cardViewScreenWidth = false layoutBackgroundBlur = true # only used when layout equals background [header] layout = \u0026#34;fixed\u0026#34; Now configure how the article and list pages will look. Here are the configurations for those.\n[article] showHero = true heroStyle = \u0026#34;background\u0026#34; showSummary = true showTableOfContents = true showRelatedContent = true relatedContentLimit = 3 [list] showCards = true groupByYear = false cardView = true If you run hugo server again, you should see something like the image below.\nAdding content to your site # Create a folder to place your posts in /content/posts. This was also the directory configured in your menu to list all the articles. Within that folder, let’s create a new directory and give it the name myfirstpost. Within it create an index.md file – your article and place a featured.jpg or .png for in the same directory as the thumbnail for the article. Use the example below to get started. The first lines in the file are the Front Matter, which tell Hugo what the look and experience of the article will be – different themes support different params for this. Check the docs for more info.\n--- title: \u0026#34;My first post\u0026#34; date: 2023-08-14 draft: false summary: \u0026#34;This is my first post on my site\u0026#34; tags: [\u0026#34;space\u0026#34;] --- ## A sub-title Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Morbi nibh nisl, vulputate eu lacus vitae, maximus molestie libero. Vestibulum laoreet, odio et sollicitudin sollicitudin, quam ligula tempus urna, sed sagittis eros eros ac felis.

Aliquam sit amet nunc vulputate, facilisis neque in, faucibus nisl. You can create additional articles to see what your site will look like once there is content in it. Your site should look like the images below. The main page shows the recent articles, each article is connected through others automatically via related section, you have tag aggregation, and full-text search.\nShip it # The only thing missing is to ship your site. I will be using Firebase for hosting - it’s a free alternative and provides more advanced features if you are creating something more complex. Go to firebase and create a new project. Once that is done, let’s switch to the CLI as it will make it easier to configure everything.\nLet’s install firebase’s CLI - if not on Mac check install instructions on Firebase.\nbrew install firebase Now log in and init firebase hosting for the project.\nfirebase login firebase init Select hosting and proceed.\nFollow the image below for the options I recommend. Make sure to set up the workflow files for GitHub actions. These will guarantee that your code will be deployed once there is a change to the repo.\nHowever, those files will not work out-of-box, as Hugo requires extra steps for the build to work. Please copy and paste the code blocks below to the respective files within the .github folder, but keep the original projectId in the files generated by firebase.\nfirebase-hosting-merge.yml # # This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI # https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on merge \u0026#39;on\u0026#39;: push: branches: - main jobs: build_and_deploy: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 env: ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; - name: Check out code into the Go module directory uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: hugo -E -F --minify -d public - name: Deploy Production uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0 with: repoToken: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\u0026#39; firebaseServiceAccount: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BLOWFISH_TUTORIAL }}\u0026#39; channelId: live projectId: blowfish-tutorial firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml # # This file was auto-generated by the Firebase CLI # https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools name: Deploy to Firebase Hosting on PR \u0026#39;on\u0026#39;: pull_request jobs: build_and_preview: if: \u0026#39;${{ github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository }}\u0026#39; runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 env: ACTIONS_ALLOW_UNSECURE_COMMANDS: \u0026#39;true\u0026#39; - name: Check out code into the Go module directory uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: true # Fetch Hugo themes (true OR recursive) fetch-depth: 0 # Fetch all history for .GitInfo and .Lastmod - name: Build with Hugo env: # For maximum backward compatibility with Hugo modules HUGO_ENVIRONMENT: production HUGO_ENV: production run: hugo -E -F --minify -d public - name: Deploy preview uses: FirebaseExtended/action-hosting-deploy@v0 with: repoToken: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\u0026#39; firebaseServiceAccount: \u0026#39;${{ secrets.FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BLOWFISH_TUTORIAL }}\u0026#39; expires: 30d channelId: preview-${{ github.event.number }} projectId: blowfish-tutorial The last step is committing your code to GitHub and let the workflows you created take care of deploying your site. Since we configured GitHub actions, this will trigger a job that will configure and deploy your site automatically.\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026#34;add github actions workflows\u0026#34; git push If the actions tab for your repo, you should see something like this.\nOnce all the steps finish, your Firebase console should show something like the image below - including the links to see your app – I got a version of this tutorial running on https://blowfish-tutorial.web.app/.\nConclusion and Next Steps # Now you have your first version of your homepage. You can make changes locally and once you commit your code they will automatically be reflected online. What shall you do next?
